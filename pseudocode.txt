-Create a trvia game with timed questions

-Create an array of questions
-Each question should have an array of answers
-The answers can have more strings than will be presented
    -This will allow for questions to get randomly generated answers making it slightly more difficult and adds replayability
    -Math.floor(Math.random() * (1, answerArray.length))
        -This should be put into a function so everytime it's called a new number is generated

HTML:
-Create a div to present the question
    -<div id="question">
-Create a div to present the answers
    -<div id="answerPane"
    -Inside this div, there should be radio options = 4
    -One right answer and 3 random incorrect answers.
-Create a win tracker
    -<div id="tracker>
        -<p id="winRate">
            -As questions are answered correctly, increase the win rate
-Create a loss tracker
    -Inside the tracker div:
        -<p id="lossRate">
            -As questions are answered incorrectly, increase the loss rate
-Create a div for time remaining
    -<div id="timeRemaining>

JS:
-Create an array of questions
    -Perhaps the array should include attributes, with an answers key
    -Create approx 6 answers.
        -Math.floor(Math.random(Answers.length))
        -Select 3 incorrect answers and one normal answer
        -Randomly display the answers, not in order
            -This can be done with another random number 
-Create a timeout for the question
    -If the time runs up, increase the loss rate
    -If the question is answered correctly, increase the win rate
        -Take the win and loss rate and give and average them together to give the player an overall score
-Create buttons which will update dynamically per question
